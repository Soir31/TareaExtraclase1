## Gregory Alpizar's group Documentation

In this project we made an alternative version of the famous game "Space Invaders" in which we implemented the different types of linked lists in Java to give different behaviors
to the enemies and also applied different Oriented Object Programming methods. Space Invaders is a game in which the player controls a spaceship and shoots missiles to alien like
looking enemies that are the invaders to protect the planet. The enemies will move down, left and right in the screen to try to reach the planet and invade it.

### Jira

We kept a record of the tasks we assigned to each member of the group and its progress in [Jira](https://thespaceinvaders.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DATOS12021/boards/1/backlog).
In here you can watch how the different tasks were made and who and the progress of how we developed the game.

### Class Diagram
We also made a class diagram to have an idea of what we needed and what we wanted to do before starting to make the game.

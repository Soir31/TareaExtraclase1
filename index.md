## Gregory Alpizar's group Documentation

In this project we made an alternative version of the famous game "Space Invaders" in which we implemented the different types of linked lists to give different behaviors to the
enemies. 

### Jira

We kept a record of the tasks we made in [Jira](https://thespaceinvaders.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DATOS12021/boards/1/backlog) to organize which tasks
corresponded to who.

### Class Diagram
We also made a class diagram to have an idea of what we needed before starting to make the game.

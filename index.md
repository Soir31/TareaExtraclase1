## Gregory Alpizar's group Documentation

In this project we made an alternative version of the famous game "Space Invaders" in which we implemented the different types of linked lists to give different behaviors to the
enemies. We kept a record of the tasks we made in [Jira](https://thespaceinvaders.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/DATOS12021/boards/1/backlog) to organize which tasks
corresponded to who.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Soir31/TareaExtraclase1/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes
